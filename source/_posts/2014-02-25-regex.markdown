I think about all the tens of thousands(more?) of online forms I've filled in over the years.  I'd like to think myself or my Chrome auto-fill has done fairly good work.  However, after spending the last 24hrs on RegEx I'm certain that I got so good at entering forms because of how good the validation was on all the sites I've been using.

The web has been training me to enter in forms as they expect, phone numbers with or without dashes or passwords that contain a certain amount of some characters, some digits, some capital, etc.  Prior to learning RegEx I really had no clue how all of those validations were done without a lot of code and while I appreciate the amount of code it actually takes to validate input, it sure is hard to read!

It might almost be pass√© to complain about RegEx as of 2014 but I found a video that pretty much sums up what it's like to try and refine your projects to have less code:
