Happy January 13th everyone!  I'm really excited today as I've launched this blog using some wonderful Ruby on Rails gems.  Since this is my first post, I think I should explain where I am at today but also where I'm coming from.

Learning programming has been an on & off again relationship - one that started when I was 13 and has continued to rear it's head time and time again.  This time though, as I'm anxiously approaching the daunting year that I turn 30 - I have finally conceded to my own intuition.  

See back in High School, I coded and I coded hard.  I had 3 machines running Linux. I wrote a script that made my mom solve complex math problems before she could log onto the machine (she loved this - I swear.  I called it the "logger logger"), I had auto-responders on IRC before there was a bot to do that and I eventually made a program that enabled me to write plain text (in English) and it would spit out my Spanish homework.  

However, at the age of 18 - I convinced myself that coding wasn't a "creative endeavor".  That it wasn't going to be where I left my mark on the world and that I should try something else.  I went to college, studied business and eventually hung up my programming hat for a while. 

After a series of mediocre jobs, none that really intrigued me or asked me to solve any real-world issues, I came back to programming with a new sense of purpose.  I didn't know what that purpose was, I just knew that I was underutilized in my job and therefore wanted to try my hand at developing again.  I'm more experienced in life and in business, but more importantly I have a firm understanding of certain areas in the world that have gaps - some that I think I can help overcome.  

In the end, my goal here is a bit selfish, that is to make a better me - one that involves a live and a career that makes me a forever student.  Iâ€™m the last person to claim to know everything and I think this future career in development fits that mindset, perfectly.
