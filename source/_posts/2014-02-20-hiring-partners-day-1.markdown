Today was a fun day at Launch Academy - not only did we really dive into methods but we had a great Q&A section with a few of the hiring partners.

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tonywieczorek">Tony Wieczorek of Firecracker</a> instantly became a voice of reason in a discussion about jobs and work environments.  While most of the facilitation was in regards to what we will be asked in an interview, he answered my question of "What can we ask in an interview?" with the most sincerity.  While I understand, hiring is a partnership, the landscape of start-ups seems so vast that landing at the right company is important to me.  What I mean by that, is I am currently going through a very intense program, one that continues to build on itself (Anthony += Anthony).  I'd love for this learning to continue at this pace, regardless of where I go and I want a corporate culture that reflects that.  When Tony said I should ask to meet a team (if it's smaller) and get a tour of the facilities a light bulb went off!

<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/catherine-powell/0/691/b92">Katherin Powell of Groupize</a> was next and the jokes started early!  Overly sarcastic, very intelligent but also humble!  She gave some great insight into what it's like working at a tech-start up, what non-technical founders roles are but what a Jr. Developer might be walking into.  She also answered my question about corporate culture and said that I should really ask these questions at the interview, I should be able to tell early on what it might be like.

<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/zachjyoung">Zach of Gameface Media</a> was a former cohorter from LA and was very excited for all of us in this Spring Cohort.  He had some great advice about not giving up, continuing to grow as developers and to also network outside of the tech industry.  Emphasizing to really use our own interests to help guide us to an area we'd love to work in.  Brilliant!
