Thursday of this week at LA was fantastic, we actually got an overview on JSON.  Why JSON?  Well this talk was really focused around data structures, especially nested data structures (I'd normally insert an Xzibit meme here about putting hashes with your hashes but nothing clever is coming out today).

You always read blog articles cursing XML but favoring JSON but honestly those articles were a bit over my head at the time.  After pushing through some serious discomfort with nested data structures, especially an extra credit assignment that I mentioned below (see my pry post), I've gotten more comfortable with them.  That said, it wasn't until the JSON facilitation that I saw why we were spending so much time on this topic.

See prior to LA, I tried making a Justin Bieber app that searched twitter and other JSON type API's for certain criteria.  Getting through those files and getting out just what I needed felt impossible.  After just a week of really spending time in nested structures, I can say that JSON files are no longer intimidating to me and that I am very excited to start exploring some more!
