A week of no blog posts again?  Are you serious?  I know, I know - fingers must be pointed.  That said, I don't think you'd want to read a blog post of mine after 12 or more hours of coding in a single day.

Week 4 was awesome though as a number of things came together for me.  First we finally got into rails and I mean dug down deep!  The mysteries of ActiveRecord came to light and the SQL queries emerged (ya ya ya, I know you can see them on the command line).  We spent a good 2 days on SQL and that really helped me when it came to ActiveRecord.

We also touched on ActiveModel, ActionPack & ActiveSupport which is helping me tremendously with older rails projects I had started prior to LA.  Here were some other highlights:


- MVC will probably be the initials of my first child - as Dan said, we really need to take this idea to heart.

- I think I have my idea for my breakable toy (thnk of my breakable toy project as my LA final project)

- I got good with SQL sub-queries

Week 5 has been focused on ActiveRecord and database schema which has been awesome!  I'll be sure update the blog with more as I go through all the work.
