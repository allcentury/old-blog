Week 1 is a wrap!  While I spent most of the time "in the weeds" I tried my best to reflect on each day as it went.  Sometimes it's easy to put into words what I learned that day, other times it's a bit more abstract.

The most valuable tool I learned this week was in regards to workflow.  Specifically, I think pair programming is fantastic!
So many times I've stared at a problem for hours which only seems to make matters worse.  However in the pair programming world, you can take a step back, let your partner drive for a bit and think about the problem at a higher level.  This was especially nice for me as I never spent white boarding problems (ever) until this week and it drastically changed my problem solving skills (for the better).

While I know pair programming generally consists of two people, I actually had a third in my group this week.  However, myself and Greg were at a very similar experience level but Dan wasn't as comfortable with ruby yet.  Greg and I would debate and debate over complex ideas but it wasn't until we both tried to explain our ideas to Dan that we realized we were over complicating the problem.  I mention this because pair programming doesn't require you pair with someone at your same level, in fact we think having Dan there forced us to explain our rationale in a very detailed way which sometimes lead us to a different approach.

The next big item for me was context.  You can imagine after reading 5 different books on RoR and watching countless videos on my own, that my internal dictionary of terms and their definitions were getting a bit scrambled.  Having the lectures really cemented ideas about ruby that I had previously read about.  It also allowed me to speak to my peers more explicitly which then helped me communicate my ideas regarding the problem at hand.

With all that said, I'm a bit afraid my normal communication might be suffering a bit.  Last night at dinner while wearing a sweatshirt covered in reindeers, I was trying to find the word to describe said sweatshirt.  Instead though, I just started spitting out random ruby... NameError: undefined sweatshirt. Then when I wanted to ask if the dishwasher had been emptied I spewed: dishwasher.isempty?

... crickets ...

"Are you looking for the word festive?", she said.  YES!

sweatshirt.festive?

That *should* certainly return true...
