  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a project that utilizes the Geocoder gem and as an avid
TDD&#8217;r I was trying to prevent my tests from hitting Google&rsquo;s servers a million
times.  Frankly I run my test suite a lot throughout the course of a day so
having this was necessary because I hit Google&rsquo;s limits a few times.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my set-up which somewhat similar to Samuel Mullen&rsquo;s with more of a focus on RSpec.</p>

<p><code>Gemfile</code>:</p>

<p>Once you have that, you simply need to use the new RSpec Rails helper, found in <code>spec/rails_helper.rb</code> and include this line near the top</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 7 is a wrap!  I&rsquo;ve only aged 7 weeks but I feel like I&rsquo;ve learned more in that amount of time than all those years of college.  Programming and web development in general, is simply a snowball ride.  You start with a snowball about the size of a peanut and with enough momentum, well&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="http://www.clearpointcreditcounselingsolutions.org/wp-content/uploads/Debt-Snowball-Method-Building-Momentum.jpg"></p>

<p>So that said, I certainly understand the need to keep going at this pace (unsure how sustainable that is but we&rsquo;ll see).</p>

<p>To bring you up to speed, since my last post we&rsquo;ve done a lot!  In the last 2 weeks, we&rsquo;ve really gotten into using TDD in rails and it&rsquo;s been a bit hard.  While TDD was more straightforward regarding unit tests, I never even thought about testing my web application with tests.  I thought my fumbling around each page, trying to &lsquo;break it&rsquo;, was sufficient enough.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with outside-in development and acceptance tests, the path to follow is generally:</p>

<p><img src="http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/london_school_001.jpg"></p>

<p>An acceptance test is really just a user experience on your site and thanks to some gems like Capybara I&rsquo;m able to actually move through my web application without going to my web application.  Is there a form on the home page you need to fill out?  Well I can test that, not only that form is there, that it has the right fields and given the right (or wrong) data, it will do something.</p>

<p>Imagine how many ways you try and break those forms, give it a name when it needs a number, a number when it needs an email, and the list goes on &amp; on.   Thankfully if I just write some automated tests once, I can reuse those time and time again making my application even more failsafe.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m excited to finish the next 3 weeks strong but I&rsquo;m hopeful I land at a place that will continue to let me grow at this pace!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am now half launcher, half I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing.  It feels good &ndash; mostly.  The last few weeks have been especially rewarding because projects are starting to take shape.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spent the last week really focused on ActiveRecord and my explicit nature has cursed the Object Association Gods.  It&rsquo;s a little too easy, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>In SQL I have to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>movie_search</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="o">*</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">movies</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">ORDER</span> <span class="k">BY</span> <span class="n">rating</span> <span class="k">DESC</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in ActiveRecord the statement is simply:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>movie_search</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Movie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">rating</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">:desc</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The relationships though are really where ActiveRecord starts to do some magic.  In SQL you have to join tables together like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>movie_studio</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="n">movies</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">studios</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">movies</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">JOIN</span> <span class="n">studios</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">ON</span> <span class="n">movies</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">studio_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">studios</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="k">WHERE</span> <span class="n">studio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>However in ActiveRecord:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>movie_studio</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="no">Movie</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">studio</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Well.  Can&rsquo;t really argue with that, can you?</p>

<p>All in all, the last 5 weeks have been awesome!  I&rsquo;ve been tinkering with rails for a bit now and while tutorials are great, I&rsquo;ve felt like I&rsquo;ve really dived under the hood at Launch Academy and it&rsquo;s infinitely increased my learning power &amp; potential.  Ending today on a high!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A week of no blog posts again?  Are you serious?  I know, I know &ndash; fingers must be pointed.  That said, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d want to read a blog post of mine after 12 or more hours of coding in a single day.</p>

<p>Week 4 was awesome though as a number of things came together for me.  First we finally got into rails and I mean dug down deep!  The mysteries of ActiveRecord came to light and the SQL queries emerged (ya ya ya, I know you can see them on the command line).  We spent a good 2 days on SQL and that really helped me when it came to ActiveRecord.</p>

<p>We also touched on ActiveModel, ActionPack &amp; ActiveSupport which is helping me tremendously with older rails projects I had started prior to LA.  Here were some other highlights:</p>

<li><p>MVC will probably be the initials of my first child &ndash; as Dan said, we really need to take this idea to heart.</p></li>
<li><p>I think I have my idea for my breakable toy (thnk of my breakable toy project as my LA final project)</p></li>
<li><p>I got good with SQL sub-queries</p></li>
</ul>


<hr />

<p>Week 5 has been focused on ActiveRecord and database schema which has been awesome!  I&rsquo;ll be sure update the blog with more as I go through all the work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The blog was quiet this week &ndash; not because I didn&rsquo;t learn anything but because it&rsquo;s hard to speak and communicate about concepts that are so new.  That said, each day I learned a lot and the pieces of puzzle are becoming ever more clear.</p>

<p>We started the week with Object Oriented Principles.  In our prework we read Sandy Metz&rsquo;s book Object Oriented Design and at that time it was a little hard to take it all in.  After coding some OOP challenges both individually and in pairs, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot.  I&rsquo;ve learned how objects really do shape the very contruct of our programs and why it is best practice to keep your objects simple and concise.</p>

<p>Later in the week we started to put TDD (Test Driven Development) into practice.  TDD, which I can poorly describe in one sentence as the computer programming paradigm that asks you to write tests before you write any code.  This might sound weird but after doing it myself for the last 3 days, I can say that I&rsquo;m hooked!  TDD forces me to do a few things &ndash; 1.) it makes me outline everything before I code and 2.) it keeps me on task.</p>

<p>I struggle with the hundred &ldquo;what if&rsquo;s&rdquo; while coding but TDD squashes those thoughts.  It forces me to make my tests pass, one by one thereby eliminating any potential squandering.  The hardest part about TDD was how far to test the boundaries of the Right BICEP model but I&rsquo;m sure that will come with experience!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thursday of this week at LA was fantastic, we actually got an overview on JSON.  Why JSON?  Well this talk was really focused around data structures, especially nested data structures (I&rsquo;d normally insert an Xzibit meme here about putting hashes with your hashes but nothing clever is coming out today).</p>

<p>You always read blog articles cursing XML but favoring JSON but honestly those articles were a bit over my head at the time.  After pushing through some serious discomfort with nested data structures, especially an extra credit assignment that I mentioned below (see my pry post), I&rsquo;ve gotten more comfortable with them.  That said, it wasn&rsquo;t until the JSON facilitation that I saw why we were spending so much time on this topic.</p>

<p>See prior to LA, I tried making a Justin Bieber app that searched twitter and other JSON type API&rsquo;s for certain criteria.  Getting through those files and getting out just what I needed felt impossible.  After just a week of really spending time in nested structures, I can say that JSON files are no longer intimidating to me and that I am very excited to start exploring some more!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Launch Academy started off a bit slow this week at least for me.  Friday we received a challenge that I was able to solve by Monday morning but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.  I got very familiar with nested data structures quickly and I think after endless tinkering I got the program working.</p>

<p>That said, the rest of the class really struggled with the exercise and because of that the load was lessened for a few days.  I did have some non-core exercises I got to work on, including some additional nested/compound data structures and I got to use a lovely little gem named Sinatra.</p>

<p>However, Sinatra is not the focus of this post &ndash; my new workflow is.  In high school, I was forced to test my code with endless print statements like &ldquo;x here should be 2&rdquo;, or &ldquo;this will never get printed to the screen&rdquo; (yet it always got printed to the screen).  Enter a ruby gem called &lsquo;pry&rsquo;.  If it sounds invasive, it is!  Imagine the ability to stop your program in mid-thought and ask all the questions, you&rsquo;ve always wanted&hellip;</p>

<p>This method above iterates over a nested hash and checks if the ingredients on a menu includes eggs.  That part isn&rsquo;t really important, it&rsquo;s the magic of line 6.  When the program runs, it will stop dead in it&rsquo;s tracks (though not error) at line 6.  I can then ask the program what the value of every variable is above line 6.  Can I possibly remember what all of those are, at each instance?  No way, I&rsquo;m just a simpleton.  With pry though, I can easily validate my results and even more importantly find the problematic lines with ease.  My favorite part about pry though is being able to type &ldquo;next&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;continue&rdquo; to walk through the program, line by line (still amazed by this).  If I had a tool like this in high school I think things would have ended up a lot differently for me&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I think about all the tens of thousands(more?) of online forms I&rsquo;ve filled in over the years.  I&rsquo;d like to think myself or my Chrome auto-fill has done fairly good work.  However, after spending the last 24hrs on RegEx I&rsquo;m certain that I got so good at entering forms because of how good the validation was on all the sites I&rsquo;ve been using.</p>

<p>The web has been training me to enter in forms as they expect, phone numbers with or without dashes or passwords that contain a certain amount of some characters, some digits, some capital, etc.  Prior to learning RegEx I really had no clue how all of those validations were done without a lot of code and while I appreciate the amount of code it actually takes to validate input, it sure is hard to read!</p>

<p>It might almost be passé to complain about RegEx as of 2014 but I found a video that pretty much sums up what it&rsquo;s like to try and refine your projects to have less code:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Week 1 is a wrap!  While I spent most of the time &ldquo;in the weeds&rdquo; I tried my best to reflect on each day as it went.  Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to put into words what I learned that day, other times it&rsquo;s a bit more abstract.</p>

<p>The most valuable tool I learned this week was in regards to workflow.  Specifically, I think pair programming is fantastic!
So many times I&rsquo;ve stared at a problem for hours which only seems to make matters worse.  However in the pair programming world, you can take a step back, let your partner drive for a bit and think about the problem at a higher level.  This was especially nice for me as I never spent white boarding problems (ever) until this week and it drastically changed my problem solving skills (for the better).</p>

<p>While I know pair programming generally consists of two people, I actually had a third in my group this week.  However, myself and Greg were at a very similar experience level but Dan wasn&rsquo;t as comfortable with ruby yet.  Greg and I would debate and debate over complex ideas but it wasn&rsquo;t until we both tried to explain our ideas to Dan that we realized we were over complicating the problem.  I mention this because pair programming doesn&rsquo;t require you pair with someone at your same level, in fact we think having Dan there forced us to explain our rationale in a very detailed way which sometimes lead us to a different approach.</p>

<p>The next big item for me was context.  You can imagine after reading 5 different books on RoR and watching countless videos on my own, that my internal dictionary of terms and their definitions were getting a bit scrambled.  Having the lectures really cemented ideas about ruby that I had previously read about.  It also allowed me to speak to my peers more explicitly which then helped me communicate my ideas regarding the problem at hand.</p>

<p>With all that said, I&rsquo;m a bit afraid my normal communication might be suffering a bit.  Last night at dinner while wearing a sweatshirt covered in reindeers, I was trying to find the word to describe said sweatshirt.  Instead though, I just started spitting out random ruby&hellip; NameError: undefined sweatshirt. Then when I wanted to ask if the dishwasher had been emptied I spewed: dishwasher.isempty?</p>

<p>&hellip; crickets &hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you looking for the word festive?&rdquo;, she said.  YES!</p>

<p>sweatshirt.festive?</p>

<p>That <em>should</em> certainly return true&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today was a fun day at Launch Academy &ndash; not only did we really dive into methods but we had a great Q&amp;A section with a few of the hiring partners.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tonywieczorek">Tony Wieczorek of Firecracker</a> instantly became a voice of reason in a discussion about jobs and work environments.  While most of the facilitation was in regards to what we will be asked in an interview, he answered my question of &ldquo;What can we ask in an interview?&rdquo; with the most sincerity.  While I understand, hiring is a partnership, the landscape of start-ups seems so vast that landing at the right company is important to me.  What I mean by that, is I am currently going through a very intense program, one that continues to build on itself (Anthony += Anthony).  I&rsquo;d love for this learning to continue at this pace, regardless of where I go and I want a corporate culture that reflects that.  When Tony said I should ask to meet a team (if it&rsquo;s smaller) and get a tour of the facilities a light bulb went off!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/catherine-powell/0/691/b92">Katherin Powell of Groupize</a> was next and the jokes started early!  Overly sarcastic, very intelligent but also humble!  She gave some great insight into what it&rsquo;s like working at a tech-start up, what non-technical founders roles are but what a Jr. Developer might be walking into.  She also answered my question about corporate culture and said that I should really ask these questions at the interview, I should be able to tell early on what it might be like.</p>

<p><a href="www.linkedin.com/in/zachjyoung">Zach of Gameface Media</a> was a former cohorter from LA and was very excited for all of us in this Spring Cohort.  He had some great advice about not giving up, continuing to grow as developers and to also network outside of the tech industry.  Emphasizing to really use our own interests to help guide us to an area we&rsquo;d love to work in.  Brilliant!</p>
