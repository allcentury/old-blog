title: Weechat setup for irc.gitter.im
---

I recently got back on freenode after almost a 10 year gap.  I don't know why I left but the community on there is really fantastic.

That said, I didn't really want a native osx app since I spend nearly all my time on the command line. Enter [weechat](https://weechat.org/) a wonderful terminal-based chat client that really allows me to do everything I need to.

While I mentioned freenode, I also find myself on [Github's Gitter](https://gitter.im) quite a bit which has been a great way to work with collaborators on projects.

Getting weechat to work with gitter was not as easy as weechat's built in support for freenode was so the setup took me a few days to get right.  Thanks to github user @raine](https://github.com/raine) I got the SSL configure set up but there is an extra step with fingerprints you need to configure.

The entire script is like this:

See you on gitter or freenode - I'm usually on as allcentury
